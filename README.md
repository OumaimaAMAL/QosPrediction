# QoS Prediction Project Repository

Welcome to the QoS (Quality of Service) Prediction project repository. This project aims to predict QoS values using various deep learning models. The goal is to consider some spatio-temporal features in the task of QoS Prediction. The repository is organized into three main folders to help you navigate through the development stages of the project.

## Repository Structure

### Folder 1: Initial Version (iv_codes) 

The `initial-codes` folder contains the initial brainstorming and code snippets. These may include exploratory data analysis (EDA), early code prototypes, and initial ideas related to the QoS prediction project. This section serves as the starting point for the project and provides insights into the early stages of development.

### Folder 2: Progressive Version (pv_codes)

In the `progressive-development` folder, you will find the progressive steps taken during the project's realization. This section encompasses several key aspects of the project, including:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Code and scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. This phase is crucial for preparing the data for model training.

- **Sequences Generation:** Lines of codes for generating sequences of data suitable for QoS prediction. This may involve time series data or other sequential data structures.

- **Model Construction:** Implementation of deep learning models for QoS prediction. This could include LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), or other model architectures.

- **Model Training:** Code for training the deep learning models on the prepared datasets. This section may include training loops, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

- **Results Visualization:** Codes for visualizing and analyzing the results obtained from different models. This can help in gaining insights into model performance and identifying areas for improvement.

### Folder 3: Final Updates (fv_codes)

The `latest-updates` folder contains the most recent versions of the project's code. Here, you will find updated and optimized versions of the sequential data processing, and the primary focus is on enhancing the performance of the Bi-LSTM model. The improvements are designed to make the model more specific in predicting QoS values by considering both time and task spatial properties with higher precision.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
